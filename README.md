# Social Network API
### Description
For this challenge, my goal was to build a social network API that allows users to share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and add and delete friends; as well as show the formatted date of the post. This project uses a NoSQL database (Mongoose) to store data.

 ## Installation
This application uses the following packages and dependencies:
- Express
- Mongoose
- Moment

## Usage
The packages and dependecies are installed through the command line, as is the schema. The seeds.js files are planted through a script which is activated by using 'npm run seed' in the command line. 
This program is not deployed, all functionality is checked through Insomnia.
